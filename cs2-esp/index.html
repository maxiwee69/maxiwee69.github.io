            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p> 
                This is a simple External read only ESP for CS2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would not recommend to use this on your main account as this is more like a thing for me to learn how to make an ESP and game cheats in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will try to keep this page updated as much as possible. But I am a lazy person so don't expect too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may ask why won't you release it now? It sounds pretty finished, right? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I don't want to update it every time the game gets updated. So I will have to implement a patchfinder to automatically find the offsets for the ESP. This will take some time and I am not sure if I will ever finish it. But I will try my best
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you may ask yourself what is the reason for the countdown? Well I want to motivate myself to finish this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a very lazy person and I need some motivation to finish this project. So I thought why not make a countdown and publish it on my website. This way I will have to finish it before the countdown ends.
