        Now in your terminal run tweak or point directly to the nic.pl file, you should see a lot of options but we will only focus on 1 of these
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see a lot of different options and choose the one that says "iphone/tweak" and press enter.(or if you want to use swift choose "iphone/tweak_swift")
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you will be asked to enter a name for your tweak, enter whatever you want and press enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you will be asked to enter a package name for your tweak, enter something structured like com.yourname.tweakname and press enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you will be asked to enter a author name for your tweak, enter whatever you want and press enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you will be asked for some other stuff but you can just press enter for all of these.(at least if you want to strictly follow the tutorial)

<class="tweak-folder">
    <p>
        Now you should have a folder with the name you entered earlier in your current directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now open the folder in your prefered IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should see a lot of files but we will only focus on 2 of these. One called tweak.x and one called Makefile.
    </p>
