		<h1 class="blog-title">My First Blog</h1>
        <p class="blog">Ok so i have no idea how to write a blog but ill just do it bc why not.
            ill just writre here about what i do everyday. so starting of with 
    today, today wasnt a very special day. i got up on like 11 am and just 
    layed in bett for like 30 minutes. 
            after that i did some sport like  every moring. i did some push 
    ups and sit ups. after that i ate some breakfast and then i went to my 
    computer and played some games.
            after playing some games i learned for an upcoming math exam. It's 
    a german thing called msa, i got no clue how i could explain what that is 
    so heres what chatgpt said.
            The "MSA" stands for "Mittlerer Schulabschluss" which translates 
    to "Intermediate Secondary School Leaving Certificate" in English. It is 
    an educational qualification awarded in Germany after successfully 
    completing the 10th grade at a secondary school, such as a comprehensive 
    school or a gymnasium.
    
            The MSA is an important milestone in the German education system 
    as it provides students with the opportunity to apply for vocational 
    training or further studies. It is typically an examination-based 
    qualification, comprising various written and oral exams in subjects such 
    as German, Mathematics, English, and Natural Sciences. Students must 
    achieve a minimum score to obtain the certificate.
    
            It is important to note that the MSA is not to be confused with 
    the Abitur, which is the highest qualification awarded in Germany and is 
    granted upon completion of the gymnasial upper stage.
            Ok so this explains it pretty well. after that i got back on my 
    mac and started doing exactly this. the day isnt over yet its like 3 pm so 
    the day has jus started. 
            i got and idea and wanted to bunldy all my tweaks exfept 
    fiveicondock into one tweak called noeverything but i just didnt wenat to 
    bunldy it all up and have oll of them allways turned on so i
            wanted to add preferences to make everyone able to toggle them at 
    any time. but well i wasnt able to do it because i have no idea how to 
    link preferences. so ijust turned on my ps5 and played some rainbow six 
    siege. i noticed how much this game sucks again so iturned my playstation 
    off again. My parents wanted to go out and eat with me so i did exactly 
    that. we went to my favourite restaurant its a thai restaurant. i ate egg 
    freied rice with crispy chicken. it was delicious as allways. well after 
    thzat i juts layed in bed and texted a bit, was a bit on twitter and 
    called my girlfriend and we talked a bit.
            thst was basically everything i did today so yeah if you want to 
    give me some feedback if you like this or not. </p>
